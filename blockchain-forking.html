                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    A fork occurs when a blockchain diverges into two separate
                    paths. This can happen due to changes in the software that
                    runs the blockchain or disagreements among network
                    participants about the direction the blockchain should take.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Types of Forks:</h3>

                <h4 class="text-md mt-4 font-bold">1. Soft Fork</h4>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> A soft fork is a
                    backward-compatible update to the blockchain's software
                    protocol. It allows nodes that haven't updated to the new
                    version to still interact with the network, but they might
                    be restricted from accessing certain new features.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>How It Works:</strong> In a soft fork, the new rules
                    are a stricter version of the old rules. For example, if the
                    old rule allowed block sizes of up to 1MB, a soft fork might
                    reduce this limit to 0.5MB. Nodes following the new rules
                    will accept blocks up to 0.5MB, while nodes following the
                    old rules will accept blocks up to 1MB.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>Consensus:</strong> As long as the majority of the
                    network updates to the new version, the network remains
                    unified, with both updated and non-updated nodes continuing
                    to operate on the same blockchain.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Bitcoin implemented a soft fork to
                    introduce Segregated Witness (SegWit), which changed how
                    transaction data is stored, allowing for more transactions
                    per block without increasing the block size.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-md mt-4 font-bold">2. Hard Fork</h4>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>Definition:</strong> A hard fork is a significant
                    and non-backward-compatible update to the blockchain's
                    software protocol. This type of fork creates a permanent
                    divergence in the blockchain, leading to two separate
                    blockchains that no longer interact with each other.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>How It Works:</strong> In a hard fork, the new rules
                    are not compatible with the old rules. For instance, if the
                    original blockchain allowed block sizes up to 1MB, a hard
                    fork might increase the block size limit to 2MB. Nodes that
                    adopt the new rules will follow the new blockchain, while
                    nodes that continue using the old rules will remain on the
                    original blockchain.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>New Blockchain:</strong> After a hard fork, two
                    blockchains coexistâ€”each with its own history and rules.
                    Often, this results in the creation of a new cryptocurrency
                    on the forked chain.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Bitcoin Cash is a well-known
                    example of a hard fork from Bitcoin. The fork occurred due
                    to a disagreement within the Bitcoin community about
                    increasing the block size to handle more transactions.
                    Bitcoin Cash was created with a larger block size, while
                    Bitcoin continued with the original block size.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Why Do Forks Happen?</h3>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Protocol Upgrades:</strong> Developers might
                        want to introduce new features, improve security, or fix
                        bugs in the blockchain protocol. These changes might
                        require a fork to implement.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> The introduction of SegWit
                        in Bitcoin was a protocol upgrade implemented via a soft
                        fork.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Disagreements in the Community:</strong>
                        Sometimes, the community of developers, miners, and
                        users can't agree on the direction the blockchain should
                        take. These disagreements can lead to a hard fork.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> The Ethereum community
                        experienced a hard fork after a debate over how to
                        handle a significant hack. The original blockchain
                        continued as Ethereum Classic, while the new blockchain,
                        which reversed the hack, became the current Ethereum.

                        <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> If a critical bug is
                        discovered in the blockchain's protocol, a fork might be
                        necessary to implement a fix. Depending on the nature of
                        the fix, this could be either a soft or hard fork.
                        <br><strong>Example:</strong> A hard fork might be
                        needed to fix a security vulnerability that could
                        compromise the entire network if not addressed.
