          What is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)?
          </h2>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a type of software (usually a smart
          contract) that automatically sets the price of digital assets and
          allows users to trade them on a decentralized platform. It eliminates
          the need for traditional order books (used by centralized exchanges
          like Binance) and instead uses a formula to determine asset prices.
        </p>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          In simple terms, think of an AMM as a vending machine: you put in one
          type of token (e.g., Ethereum) and get out another (e.g., USDC). The
          price you pay for the second token depends on how much is available in
          the "pool" (like how a vending machine changes prices based on
          supply).
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Example: A Basic Trade on an AMM
        </h2>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          Let’s say you’re on a decentralized exchange that uses an AMM, like
          Uniswap, and you want to trade ETH for USDC. Here's how the process
          would look:
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Liquidity Pool Setup:</h3>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          There's a liquidity pool with 100 ETH and 200,000 USDC. This pool has
          been funded by users called liquidity providers (more on that later).
          The product of these two amounts, 100 ETH x 200,000 USDC, equals
          20,000,000, which is the constant k.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">You Buy ETH:</h3>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          You want to buy 10 ETH from the pool. When you take 10 ETH out, the
          amount of ETH left in the pool decreases to 90 ETH. To maintain the
          constant product, the amount of USDC in the pool must increase. This
          will drive the price of ETH higher.
        </p>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          Here's the math: After you buy 10 ETH, the formula becomes:
          <span class="font-semibold">90 · y = 20,000,000</span>. Solving for y
          gives <span class="font-semibold">222,222 USDC</span>, meaning the
          pool now has 222,222 USDC. Therefore, to buy 10 ETH, you have to pay
          the difference:
          <span class="font-semibold"
            >222,222 USDC - 200,000 USDC = 22,222 USDC</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          So, you pay 22,222 USDC to get 10 ETH. The price of ETH has increased
          because there's now less ETH in the pool and more USDC.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Automated Pricing Without Order Books
        </h2>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          On centralized exchanges, trades rely on order books, where buyers
          place bids at their preferred price and sellers place offers. However,
          this system requires human interaction or bots, which can slow things
          down. AMMs automate the pricing and trade process using algorithms.
          Instead of matching buyers and sellers, AMMs match buyers and
          liquidity pools, allowing users to trade instantly. The pricing is
          handled automatically based on the ratio of tokens in the pool.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          How AMM Pools Change Prices
        </h2>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          AMMs use supply and demand to change prices dynamically: when a token
          is bought, the price of that token rises because its supply in the
          pool decreases; when a token is sold, the price of that token falls
          because its supply in the pool increases. The more a token is traded
          in one direction, the more the price moves in that direction. This is
          called slippage, and it happens because the AMM adjusts prices based
          on the current state of the liquidity pool.
        </p>
        <p class=" mb-4">
          Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are a critical innovation in
          decentralized finance, enabling token swaps without relying on
          traditional buyers and sellers. By using smart contracts and
          mathematical formulas, AMMs provide constant liquidity, decentralized
          trading, and the ability for users to earn passive income as liquidity
          providers. Despite the benefits, they come with certain risks like
          impermanent loss and slippage, which users need to understand before
          participating in AMM-based trading or liquidity provision.
