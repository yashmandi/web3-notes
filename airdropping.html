            Airdropping is a marketing strategy used in the cryptocurrency and
            blockchain space to distribute free tokens or coins to a specific
            group of people or to the public. It serves multiple purposes,
            including promoting a new project, rewarding loyal users, or
            increasing the visibility of a cryptocurrency.

            Key Features of Airdropping
          </h2>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 -700 mb-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Free Distribution:</strong> Airdrops involve giving away
              free tokens or coins. Users don’t need to buy anything or invest
              their money to receive them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Eligibility Criteria:</strong> Sometimes, airdrops require
              users to meet certain conditions, such as holding a specific
              cryptocurrency, signing up for a newsletter, or following the
              project's social media accounts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Types of Airdrops:</strong>
              <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                <li>
                  <strong>Standard Airdrop:</strong> Tokens are sent for free to
                  users' wallets based on certain criteria.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bounty Airdrop:</strong> Users perform tasks (like
                  sharing on social media or creating content) to earn tokens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Exclusive Airdrop:</strong> Only available to existing
                  holders of a specific cryptocurrency, often to reward loyal
                  users.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Promotion and Awareness:</strong> Airdrops create buzz
              around a new project, attracting attention and potentially
              building a user base.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wallet Addresses:</strong> To receive an airdrop, users
              typically need a compatible wallet that supports the specific
              blockchain on which the tokens are issued.

              automatically or manually.

              include access to features or governance rights.

            <li>
              <strong>Scams:</strong> Not all airdrops are legitimate; users

            <li>
              <strong>Token Value:</strong> The value of airdropped tokens can

            <li>
              <strong>Spam:</strong> Some users may receive tokens they did not

            project and increase user engagement. While it can be beneficial for
            both the project and the participants, users should remain cautious
            to avoid scams and understand the potential risks involved.
