                    A smart contract is a decentralized computer program running
                    on a blockchain network that automatically and
                    deterministically executes agreements based on predefined
                    conditions.

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Introduced in their current form by the Ethereum blockchain,
                    smart contracts are a fundamental building block for the
                    Web3 industry; the foundation for DeFi, NFT, gaming, and
                    other applications that have gained prominence in Web3.

                    exchanges, or create both fungible and non-fungible tokens,
                    smart contracts are how developers build decentralized
                    applications on blockchains. Read on for a simple

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">What Is a Smart
                    Contract?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contracts are computer programs that are hosted and
                    executed on a blockchain network. Each smart contract
                    consists of code specifying predetermined conditions that,
                    when met, trigger outcomes. By running on a decentralized
                    blockchain instead of a centralized server, smart contracts
                    allow multiple parties to come to a shared result in an
                    accurate, timely, and tamper-proof manner.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contracts are a powerful infrastructure for automation
                    because they are not controlled by a central administrator
                    and are not vulnerable to single points of attack by
                    malicious entities. When applied to multi-party digital
                    agreements, smart contract applications can reduce
                    counterparty risk, increase efficiency, lower costs, and
                    provide new levels of transparency into processes.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Blockchains and Smart
                    Contracts</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contract-enabled blockchains unlock the ability for
                    developers to write arbitrary application logic on top of
                    the decentralized consensus that blockchains natively
                    provide. That’s why blockchains, smart contracts, and
                    applications can be thought of in terms of a hierarchical
                    relationship: Applications (including tokens) are created by
                    the code from a smart contract (or multiple connected smart
                    contracts). The actions defined in a smart contract are, in
                    turn, executed and stored by the underlying blockchain
                    network.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">How Do Smart Contracts
                    Work?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contracts are tamper-proof programs on blockchains
                    with the following logic: “if/when x event happens, then
                    execute y action.” One smart contract can have multiple
                    different conditions, and one application can have multiple
                    different smart contracts to support an interconnected set
                    of processes. There are also multiple smart contract
                    languages for programming, with Ethereum’s Solidity being
                    the most popular.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Any developer can create a smart contract and deploy it on a
                    public blockchain for their own purposes, e.g., a personal
                    yield aggregator that automatically shifts their funds to
                    the highest-earning application. However, many smart
                    contracts involve multiple independent parties that may or
                    may not know one another and don’t necessarily trust one
                    another. The smart contract defines exactly how users can
                    interact with it, involving who can interact with the smart
                    contract, at what times, and what inputs result in what
                    outputs. The result is multi-party digital agreements that
                    evolve from today’s probabilistic state to a new
                    deterministic state where they are guaranteed to execute
                    according to their code.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Do All Blockchains Have Smart
                    Contracts?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Not all blockchains can run smart contracts. While
                    blockchains and layer-2 networks including Arbitrum,
                    Avalanche, Base, BNB Chain, and Ethereum are examples of
                    smart-contract-compatible blockchains, blockchains like the
                    base Bitcoin blockchain do not have native smart contract
                    capability. The key difference between these blockchains is
                    the ability of an underlying blockchain to execute and store
                    arbitrary logic.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">History of Smart
                    Contracts</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contracts were first coined by American computer
                    scientist Nick Szabo in 1994. In his seminal writing, he
                    defined a smart contract as “a computerized transaction
                    protocol that executes the terms of a contract,” aiming to
                    “satisfy common contractual conditions, minimize exceptions
                    both malicious and accidental, and minimize the need for
                    trusted intermediaries.”
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    While a general notion of smart contracts could be seen in
                    systems like vending machines, blockchains formed the
                    foundation of smart contracts that were digital,
                    tamper-proof, and permissionless. The introduction of the
                    Bitcoin blockchain in 2009 supported arguably the first
                    protocol smart contract—establishing conditions that had to
                    be satisfied to transfer Bitcoins between users on the
                    network.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    The Bitcoin blockchain then evolved to offer another major
                    type of smart contract in 2012 called a multi-signature
                    transaction. A multisig transaction requires a defined
                    number of people (public keys) to sign a transaction with
                    their private keys before it’s considered valid, increasing
                    the security of user funds.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    A simple framework for a multisig transaction on the Bitcoin
                    blockchain requires 2 out of 3 private keys to sign off on a
                    transaction before it’s considered valid. Blockchains began
                    to experiment over the next few years by adding new
                    programmatic conditions (called operation codes or opcodes).
                    However, the next major leap in smart contracts came with
                    the publication of the Ethereum whitepaper by Vitalik
                    Buterin in 2013. In 2015, Ethereum launched as a new type of
                    blockchain for programmable smart contracts.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Smart Contract Examples</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    One purpose of a smart contract is to automate a specific
                    business process between a distinct group of entities. These
                    entities collectively agree on all the smart contract’s
                    terms like payouts, process flow, and dispute resolutions. A
                    simple smart contract example for global trade may have
                    terms like:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Term 1:</strong> If the goods arrive on time,
                        then execute a payment from the retailer to the supplier
                        in full amount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Term 2:</strong> If the goods arrive one day
                        late, then execute a payment from the retailer to the
                        supplier for 98% of the full amount.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Other smart contracts support public decentralized
                    applications (dApps) that anyone can interact with without
                    needing any permissions. Public dApps are often open-source,
                    allowing anyone to inspect how they function. One example of
                    a public dApp is a decentralized lending/borrowing market,
                    which may have the following terms:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Term 1:</strong> If the user deposits collateral
                        into the smart contract, they can receive a loan up to
                        50% of the value of their collateral.</li>
                    <li><strong>Term 2:</strong> If the user’s collateralization
                        ratio drops below 200%, then the user’s collateral is
                        automatically liquidated and transferred to the
                        lenders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Term 3:</strong> Lenders can deposit funds into
                        a contract that other users can borrow from at
                        predefined collateralization ratios, while receiving a
                        claim to a portion of the interest rate payments.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Enforceability of Smart
                    Contracts</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Because they run on top of blockchains, smart contracts are
                    automatically and deterministically executed exactly as
                    programmed. In the context of enforcement, this means that
                    no party involved in a smart contract transaction can change
                    its outcome or renege on the terms outlined in the contract.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contracts can eliminate counterparty risk but
                    introduce smart contract risk, which is the risk that a
                    smart contract’s code has an exploit or flaw. Smart
                    contracts always run as programmed, so if the program is
                    faulty, the contract will execute the faulty code as
                    expected.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Additionally, some contracts are simply unenforceable
                    through code. For instance, lending protocols often require
                    overcollateralized loans because there's no way to guarantee
                    repayment unless the full amount is already in a smart
                    contract. In such cases, combining smart contracts with
                    off-chain systems like credit scores and legal contracts can
                    help mitigate counterparty risk.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Benefits and Limitations</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contracts offer a safer, more verifiable way of
                    creating societal agreements involving the transfer of value
                    and data. However, the landscape of blockchains and smart
                    contracts is still developing, and developers face various
                    limitations as they work to build the verifiable web.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-md mt-4 font-bold">Smart Contract Benefits</h4>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Most traditional digital agreements involve parties that
                    don’t know each other, introducing risks that either may not
                    uphold their commitments. To resolve this, digital
                    agreements are often executed by larger, centralized
                    institutions like banks. While this reduces risk, it also
                    creates a situation where these institutions exert influence
                    over the contracts.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Smart contracts improve upon digital agreements by offering
                    several advantages:

                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Running on decentralized
                        blockchain infrastructure ensures no central point of
                        failure and no way for either party to tamper with
                        outcomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Redundant processing and
