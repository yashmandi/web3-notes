        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-2">What is the EVM?</h2>
        <p>
          The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is like the "brain" of the Ethereum
          blockchain. It's what makes Ethereum special and allows it to perform
          tasks that other blockchains can't.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Virtual Computer</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine the EVM as a giant, virtual computer that exists across
          thousands of computers (called nodes) all over the world. When you use
          Ethereum, you're interacting with this virtual computer.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Smart Contracts</h3>
        <p>
          A smart contract is like a small computer program that runs on the
          EVM. These programs can perform tasks automatically, such as sending
          money, keeping records, or running a decentralized app (dApp). Once
          deployed, a smart contract remains on the blockchain, accessible to
          all, but unchangeable by anyone.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Programming Language</h3>
        <p>
          Smart contracts on Ethereum are typically written in a language called
          Solidity. When you write a smart contract in Solidity, it gets
          converted into bytecode, which the EVM executes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8">How Does the EVM Work?</h2>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-1">Running Smart Contracts</h3>
        <p>
          When you want to use a smart contract, your request is sent to the
          EVM. The EVM reads the bytecode of the smart contract and executes it
          as specified.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Gas and Fees</h3>
        <p>
          The EVM doesn't operate for free. Each action (like running a smart
          contract) incurs a cost known as "gas," paid in Ether (ETH). More
          complex actions require more gas.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Why Gas?</h3>
        <p>
          Gas fees exist to maintain network safety. Without them, the EVM could
          be overwhelmed with excessive requests, leading to potential slowdowns
          or crashes. Requiring gas ensures that users request meaningful work
          from the EVM.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Decentralization</h3>
        <p>
          The EVM runs on every Ethereum node globally. Thus, when you ask the
          EVM to perform an action, thousands of computers validate the work,
          making the network secure and trustworthy.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Isolation</h3>
        <p>
          Each smart contract operates in its own isolated environment within
          the EVM. This means that if one contract encounters issues, it won't
          affect others or the network itself.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8">EVM vs. Other Systems</h2>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-1">Bitcoin</h3>
        <p>
          Bitcoin, the first blockchain, does not have an EVM. Its system is
          simpler and primarily handles transactions. In contrast, the EVM
          supports more complex tasks like running dApps.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Other Blockchains</h3>
        <p>
          Other blockchains, like Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, have versions
          of the EVM or are compatible with it. This allows developers to create
          apps that function across multiple blockchains.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8">Why is the EVM Important?</h2>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-1">Flexibility</h3>
        <p>
          The EVM enables Ethereum to support a range of applications, from
          decentralized finance (DeFi) to unique digital art (NFTs), earning it
          the title "world computer."
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Innovation</h3>
        <p>
          Being Turing complete, the EVM empowers developers to find new and
          innovative uses for Ethereum, resulting in countless dApps and
          emerging technologies.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Compatibility</h3>
        <p>
          Many new blockchains aim for compatibility with Ethereum, the leading
          platform for smart contracts. This ensures they can easily support
          Ethereumâ€™s applications and contracts.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the powerful engine driving the
          Ethereum blockchain. It enables smart contracts and dApps, operating
          across thousands of nodes for security and decentralization. The
          concept of "gas" maintains network safety by requiring payment for
          computational work. Thus, Ethereum transcends being merely a
          cryptocurrency; it is a platform for the future of decentralized
          applications.
