                <p class="mt-2">A blockchain is a highly secure, reliable, and
                    decentralized network that allows people to record
                    transaction activity, store data, and exchange value in a
                    distributed ledger that is not controlled by any central
                    authority, but instead maintained by computers all around
                    the world.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">Blockchain is the foundational technology that
                    underpins the value proposition of the entire
                    cryptocurrency/Web3 ecosystem. It’s the engine that secures
                    Bitcoin and establishes the foundation for why smart
                    contracts have value.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">The fundamental value proposition of blockchains
                    is the ability to exchange value in a trust-minimized,
                    permissionless way that doesn’t require the intermediation
                    of any third party. The most basic case possible to showcase
                    this is payments or the transfer of funds from one party to
                    another.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    For example, let’s assume that Bob would like to send Alice
                    a payment. Using legacy systems, Bob would send his payment
                    to a third party—a bank or financial institution—that would
                    take full custody of his funds and transfer those funds to
                    Alice. In the case of blockchains, Bob sends money directly
                    to Alice’s account without a centralized intermediary, but
                    with full assurances that funds are transferred between
                    accounts. The transaction takes place in a decentralized
                    manner, without any intermediaries involved, enforced by
                    deterministic processes secured by cryptography, encryption,
                    math, and physics.

                <h2 class="text-xl mt-6">Who invented Blockchain Technology?
                </h2>
                <p class="mt-2">Some protocols similar to blockchain were
                    conceptualized in the early 1980s, and were implemented in
                    the 1990s for verification of document timestamps. the
                    invention of the first decentralized blockchain is widely
                    attributed to the pseudonymous person known as "Satoshi
                    Nakamoto", who published bitcoin <a

                <h2 class="text-xl mt-6">How Does a Blockchain Work?</h2>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    A blockchain is a special kind of digital record book,
                    called a ledger, that keeps track of all transactions in a
                    network. Traditionally, these records are kept by banks or
                    other organizations on their own servers. However, a
                    blockchain is different because it is stored and maintained
                    by a network of computers (called nodes) all over the world,
                    instead of just one central place.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    These computers all have the same copy of the ledger, and
                    they work together to make sure everything is accurate. On
                    public blockchains, like Bitcoin, the network uses its own
                    currency (cryptocurrency) to reward the computers (nodes)
                    for their work in maintaining the ledger.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    When someone wants to add information to the ledger, like
                    transferring money to another person, they create a
                    transaction. Each person has an account, which is like an
                    email address (public key), and a private code, similar to a
                    password (private key). The private key is used to sign the
                    transaction, which proves that the person really owns the
                    account and wants to send money.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    The transactions are grouped together into blocks, and all
                    the computers in the network check each transaction to make
                    sure it's valid. This process makes it nearly impossible for
                    anyone to tamper with the records. Once the block is
                    confirmed, it is added to a chain of previous blocks,
                    creating a "blockchain." The computers that help maintain
                    the blockchain are rewarded with small fees or new
                    cryptocurrency.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    There are different types of blockchains with varying levels
                    of openness and participation:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                    <li>Public blockchains are open to everyone.</li>
                    <li>Private blockchains are closed and only certain people
                        can use them.</li>
                    <li>Permissioned blockchains allow open access but have
                        limited participation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    Blockchains also use different methods to agree on the
                    validity of transactions, called consensus mechanisms. Some
                    common methods include proof of work (used by Bitcoin),
                    proof of stake (used by Solana), and proof of authority
                    (used by many private blockchains).
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
                    Finally, blockchains often need to make trade-offs between
                    security, decentralization, and scalability, which is known
                    as the Scalability Trilemma. They may also prioritize other
                    features like privacy or the speed at which transactions are
                    confirmed.
