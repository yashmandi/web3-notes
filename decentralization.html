        <h2 class="text-xl mt-2">What is Decentralization?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Decentralization in blockchain means that the control and
          decision-making power are distributed among all participants in the
          network, rather than being held by a single central authority or a few
          entities.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            No Central Control: Instead of one company or organization managing
            everything, everyone in the network has a copy of the blockchain and
            can participate in verifying and recording transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transparency and Security: Because everyone has a copy and can see
            the transactions, it's hard to cheat or make unauthorized changes
            without everyone noticing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resilience: If one part of the network fails or is compromised, the
            rest of the network can continue to operate without major
            disruption.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-xl mt-2">Centralization vs Decentralization</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          In a centralized system, one person or entity has control (like a bank
          controlling your account). In a decentralized system, no single person
          or entity has control. Instead, control is shared among all
          participants (like everyone having a copy of the same information).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">Key Benefits:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-1">
          <li>
            Security: Because control is spread out, it's harder for hackers to
            attack the system. In a centralized system, hacking one central
            point can compromise the entire system. In a decentralized system,
            hacking one point doesn't affect the whole network.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transparency: Everyone in the network can see and verify
            transactions. This makes it harder for anyone to cheat or hide
            information because everything is out in the open.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trust: In a decentralized system, you don't need to trust one
            central authority (like a bank or a company). The system's rules and
            processes ensure fairness, so you can trust the system as a whole.
          </li>
