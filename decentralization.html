        <h2 class="text-xl mt-2">What is Decentralization?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Decentralization in blockchain means that the control and
          decision-making power are distributed among all participants in the
          network, rather than being held by a single central authority or a few
          entities.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            No Central Control: Instead of one company or organization managing
            everything, everyone in the network has a copy of the blockchain and
            can participate in verifying and recording transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transparency and Security: Because everyone has a copy and can see
            the transactions, it's hard to cheat or make unauthorized changes
            without everyone noticing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resilience: If one part of the network fails or is compromised, the
            rest of the network can continue to operate without major
            disruption.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Centralization vs Decentralization</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          In a centralized system, one person or entity has control (like a bank
          controlling your account). In a decentralized system, no single person
          or entity has control. Instead, control is shared among all
          participants (like everyone having a copy of the same information).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">Key Benefits:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-1">
          <li>
            Security: Because control is spread out, it's harder for hackers to
            attack the system. In a centralized system, hacking one central
            point can compromise the entire system. In a decentralized system,
            hacking one point doesn't affect the whole network.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transparency: Everyone in the network can see and verify
            transactions. This makes it harder for anyone to cheat or hide
            information because everything is out in the open.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trust: In a decentralized system, you don't need to trust one
            central authority (like a bank or a company). The system's rules and
            processes ensure fairness, so you can trust the system as a whole.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-xl mt-4">Decentralization vs Trust</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          <strong>Decentralization</strong> refers to the distribution of
          control and decision-making across a network of independent
          participants (nodes) rather than relying on a single central
          authority. In a decentralized system like blockchain, multiple nodes
          validate transactions and maintain a shared ledger, ensuring no single
          entity can manipulate or control the data. This creates a trustless
          environment, where users do not need to trust any central party
          because the system's integrity is maintained by the consensus of the
          entire network.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          <strong>Trust</strong>, in contrast, is central to traditional
          systems, where users rely on centralized authorities, like banks or
          governments, to manage and secure their transactions. In these
          systems, trust is placed in the central entity to act honestly and
          protect users' interests. However, this also means that if the central
          authority is compromised, the entire system's integrity can be at
          risk.
