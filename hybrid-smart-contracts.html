                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Hybrid Smart Contracts</h2>
                <p>Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain code, which runs on a
                    blockchain, with off-chain data and computation. This
                    integration allows them to execute more complex and
                    real-world-relevant tasks than traditional smart contracts,
                    which operate solely within the blockchain's ecosystem.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-2 font-bold">Here’s how they work:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li class="mt-2"><strong>On-Chain Component:</strong> The core logic of a
                        hybrid smart contract is stored and executed on the
                        blockchain, ensuring security, transparency, and
                        immutability. This part of the contract deals with
                        actions like transferring tokens or enforcing rules
                        within the blockchain environment.</li>
                    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Off-Chain Component:</strong> Hybrid smart
                        contracts rely on off-chain data and computation to
                        gather real-world information or perform tasks that are
                        too complex or costly to be done on-chain. This is where
                        blockchain oracles come in. Oracles provide the
                        necessary data from external sources, such as market
                        prices, weather data, or event outcomes, and send it to
                        the blockchain where the smart contract can use it.</li>
                    <li class="mt-2"><strong>Interaction Between Components:</strong> The
                        on-chain and off-chain components communicate with each
                        other through oracles. This interaction allows the smart
                        contract to trigger actions based on real-world events,
                        making it "hybrid" by combining the benefits of
                        blockchain (security and transparency) with the
                        flexibility and power of external data and
                        computation.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3  class="mt-2 font-bold">Example Use Case:</h3>
                <p>Imagine a decentralized insurance contract that pays out
                    claims based on weather conditions. The on-chain smart
                    contract would handle the insurance policy and payments,
                    while an oracle would provide weather data from a trusted
                    source. If the oracle reports that certain conditions are
                    met (like a flood), the smart contract automatically
                    triggers the payout.</p>

                <h3  class="mt-2 font-bold">Why They Matter:</h3>
                <p>Hybrid smart contracts are crucial for expanding the
                    potential applications of blockchain technology. They enable
                    the development of more sophisticated decentralized
                    applications (dApps) that can interact with the real world,
                    making blockchain solutions more practical and versatile in
                    various industries, including finance, supply chain
                    management, insurance, and more.</p>
