        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-2">What is Cryptography?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">Cryptography is the science of securing information
          through mathematical techniques that transform data into a format that
          is unreadable to unauthorized parties. It is fundamental to modern
          digital security, ensuring that sensitive data remains private,
          authentic, and unaltered during transmission and storage. Cryptography
          is essential in protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and
          authenticity of information.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-6">Types of Cryptography</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          There are three main types of cryptography:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2">
          <li class="mt-2">
            Symmetric-Key Cryptography
            <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mt-1">
              <li>
                In symmetric-key cryptography, the same key is used for both
                encryption and decryption.
              </li>
              <li>
                The key must be kept secret and shared between the sender and
                the receiver.
              </li>
              <li> Example:
                <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mt-1">
                  <li>
                    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) : A
                    widely used encryption method that uses a single key for
                    both encryption and decryption. It’s fast and efficient for
                    encrypting large volumes of data.

                  <li>
                    Two parties, Alice and Bob, want to communicate securely.
                    Alice encrypts a message with a shared secret key, sends it
                    to Bob, and Bob decrypts it using the same key.

            Asymmetric-Key Cryptography (Public-Key
            Cryptography)
            <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mt-1">
              <li>
                Asymmetric cryptography uses two different keys: a public key
                and a private key.
              </li>
              <li>
                The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept
                secret.
              </li>
              <li>
                The public key is used to encrypt the data, and only the
                corresponding private key can decrypt it.
              </li>

                    recipient's public key, and decryption is done with their
                    private key.

                    using his private key.

            Hash Functions
            <ul class="list-disc ml-4 mt-1">
              <li>
                Hash functions are a one-way cryptographic operation that take
                an input (or message) and return a fixed-size string of bytes,
                typically a hash.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unlike encryption, hash functions are irreversible. They are
                commonly used to verify data integrity and authenticate
                messages.
              </li>

                    unique, fixed-size output (hash) for any given input.

                    When a file is downloaded, its hash is compared to the
                    original file's hash to ensure no changes occurred during
                    transmission (integrity verification).

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-6">How is Cryptography used in
          Blockchain?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          Cryptography is a cornerstone of blockchain technology, enabling its
          core features of security, transparency, and immutability. Here’s how
          cryptography is applied in blockchain:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Digital Signatures:
            <p>
              Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography to verify the
              authenticity and integrity of transactions. When a user initiates
              a transaction, they sign it with their private key. The signature
              is then verified by nodes using the corresponding public key,
              ensuring that the transaction was indeed made by the rightful
              owner and has not been altered.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Hashing and Data Integrity:
            <p>
              Blockchain uses hash functions to create a unique identifier
              (hash) for each block of transactions. Each block contains the
              hash of the previous block, creating a chain of blocks (hence the
              term "blockchain"). This ensures that any change to a block would
              alter its hash, breaking the chain and alerting the network to the
              tampering. This makes the blockchain immutable, as altering data
              in one block would require altering all subsequent blocks, which
              is computationally infeasible.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Proof of Work (PoW):
            <p>
              In Proof of Work, miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle
              that involves finding a hash that meets certain criteria. This
              process requires significant computational effort, ensuring that
              it is difficult and resource-intensive to alter the blockchain.
              The difficulty of the puzzle ensures that the network remains
              secure against attacks, as altering the blockchain would require
              re-solving the puzzle for all subsequent blocks.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Encryption of Private Data:
            <p>
              In some blockchain implementations, certain data (like user
              identities or sensitive transaction details) may be encrypted to
              protect privacy. Only authorized parties with the correct
              decryption key can access this information, ensuring that
              sensitive data remains confidential.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Merkle Trees:
            <p>
              Blockchain uses Merkle trees, a cryptographic structure that
              enables efficient and secure verification of large sets of data.
              In a Merkle tree, each leaf node is a hash of a block of data, and
              each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes. This structure
              allows for quick and secure verification of individual
              transactions within a block without needing to check the entire
              block's contents.
