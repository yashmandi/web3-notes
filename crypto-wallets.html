                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Cryptocurrency wallets store users’ public and private keys
                    while providing an easy-to-use interface to manage crypto
                    balances. They also support cryptocurrency transfers through
                    the blockchain. Some wallets even allow users to perform
                    certain actions with their crypto assets, such as buying and
                    selling or interacting with decentralized applications
                    (dApps).
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    It is important to remember that cryptocurrency transactions
                    do not represent a ‘sending’ of crypto tokens from one
                    mobile phone to another. When sending tokens, a user’s
                    private key signs the transaction and broadcasts it to the
                    blockchain network. The network then includes the
                    transaction to reflect the updated balance in both the
                    sender’s and recipient’s addresses.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    So, the term ‘wallet’ is somewhat of a misnomer, as crypto
                    wallets don’t actually store cryptocurrency in the same way
                    physical wallets hold cash. Instead, they read the public
                    ledger to show the balances in a user’s addresses, as well
                    as hold the private keys that enable the user to make
                    transactions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Why Is a Crypto Wallet Needed
                    for Storing Crypto Assets?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    A user’s cryptocurrency is only as safe as the method they
                    use to store it. While crypto can technically be stored
                    directly on an exchange, it is not advisable to do so unless
                    in small amounts or with the intention of trading
                    frequently. For larger amounts, it’s recommended that a user
                    withdraws the majority to a crypto wallet, whether that be a
                    hot wallet or a cold one. This way, they retain ownership of
                    their private keys and have full power and control over
                    their own finances.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">How Do Cryptocurrency Wallets
                    Work?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    As mentioned earlier, a crypto wallet doesn’t technically
                    hold a user’s coins. Instead, it holds the key to their
                    coins, which are stored on public blockchain networks. In
                    order to perform various transactions, a user needs to
                    verify their wallet address via a private key that comes in
                    a set of specific codes. The speed and security often depend
                    on the kind of wallet a user has.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Why Are Wallets
                    Extensions?</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Wallet extensions are
                        designed to integrate seamlessly into web browsers,
                        making it easy for users to access their wallets without
                        switching between applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Browser extensions
                        provide a user-friendly interface for managing
                        cryptocurrencies, simplifying complex processes for
                        beginners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct DApp Interaction:</strong> Wallet
                        extensions allow users to connect directly to dApps on
                        the web, enabling transaction signing and asset
                        management without leaving the application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Extensions can offer
                        additional security features, such as requiring a
                        password or biometric authentication to access the
                        wallet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> Being
                        browser-based allows wallet extensions to be used across
                        different devices, making asset management easier.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Types of Crypto Wallets</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    There are two main types of cryptocurrency wallets:
                    software-based hot wallets and physical cold wallets. Read
                    on to learn about the different types of crypto wallets, and
                    which may be the best fit.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> These are connected to the
                        internet, making funds easily accessible but also more
                        vulnerable to hacks. Private keys are stored and
                        encrypted on the app itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cold Wallets:</strong> These are entirely
                        offline and offer greater security. Examples include
                        physical mediums like paper or engraved metal.

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">How Do Wallets Interact with
                    dApps (Overview)</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Wallets interact with decentralized applications (dApps) by
                    acting as the bridge between the user and the blockchain.
                    Here’s an overview of how wallets and dApps communicate:
                </p>

                <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Connecting to the dApp:</strong>
                        <p>When a user opens a dApp, they are prompted to
                            connect their wallet, which triggers a connection
                            request.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reading Data from the Blockchain:</strong>
                        <p>Once connected, the dApp can read data from the
                            blockchain, such as token balances or transaction
                            history.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Transaction Requests:</strong>
                        <p>When performing an action, the dApp prepares a
                            transaction and sends it to the wallet, which the
                            user reviews and signs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Monitoring and Finalizing the
                            Transaction:</strong>
                        <p>Once confirmed, the dApp updates the user interface
                            and notifies the user about the transaction
                            status.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="text-lg mt-4 font-bold">Role of Wallets</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Wallets protect the user’s
                        private keys and never expose them to the dApp.</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Wallets simplify
                        interactions with the blockchain by managing gas fees
                        and signing processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Control:</strong> Wallets ensure that users
                        retain control over their dApp interactions and
                        transactions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Web3.js or Ethers.js:</strong> Libraries that
                        dApps use to connect with wallets.</li>
                    <li><strong>RPC (Remote Procedure Calls):</strong> Used by
