        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-2">What is Consensus?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          In the blockchain, a consensus mechanism is a system that validates a
          transaction and marks it as authentic. This mechanism lists all valid
          transactions of a coin in a blockchain to build trust in the coin
          among traders. Several currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc., use
          this system for security purposes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-6">Proof of Work (PoW)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Proof of work (PoW) is a decentralized consensus mechanism used in
          many cryptocurrencies to verify the accuracy of transactions on a
          blockchain network.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Proof of work is a concept used in some public blockchains to
          demonstrate that a program did the work required to propose a new
          block for the chain. It is commonly called a consensus mechanism
          because, eventually, network consensus is reached after there is proof
          the work was done honestly (in this case, "honestly" means there were
          no attempts to alter data).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Proof of work is provided by sending the information in a block
          through a hashing algorithm, then adjusting variable fields until a
          hexadecimal number is reached that has a lower value than the
          network's difficulty target. This serves as proof that the program
          expended the computational effort to "hash" the block until a solution
          was reached.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-6">Proof of Stake (PoS)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism where participants,
          called validators, are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount
          of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to lock up as collateral.
          Validators earn rewards for validating transactions, which encourages
          them to act honestly. PoS is more energy-efficient compared to Proof
          of Work (PoW) and aims to maintain network security through economic
          incentives.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-6">
          Proof of Stake (PoS) vs. Proof of Work (PoW)
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Proof of Work (PoW) relies on miners solving complex mathematical
          puzzles to add new blocks, requiring significant energy and
          computational power. In contrast, Proof of Stake (PoS) selects
          validators to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency
          they hold and stake, making it more energy-efficient. PoW emphasizes
          computational effort for security, while PoS focuses on economic
          incentives and ownership.
